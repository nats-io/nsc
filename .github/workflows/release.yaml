      # At present (2022-02) the nsc auto-updater logic requires that we name the tags without the v prefix.
      # Obviously if we change that, we'll still have an installed base with the old logic so won't be able to start using the new naming for some time.
      # We match on v* for consistency and with an eye to the future.
      # To avoid random experimental tags creating releases, we use ${major}.* and ${nextmajor}.* for the rules which will actually match.
      # We allow 0.0.X for debugging of release engineering processes, where it won't create a new release.
