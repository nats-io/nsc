# We are sh, not bash; we might want bash/zsh for associative arrays but some
# OSes are currently on bash3 and removing bash, while we don't want a zsh
# dependency; so we're sticking to "pretty portable shell" even if it's a
# little more convoluted as a result.
#
# We rely upon the following beyond basic POSIX shell:
#  1. A  `local`  command (built-in to shell; almost all sh does have this)
#  2. A  `curl`   command (to download files)
#  3. An `unzip`  command (to extract content from .zip files)
#  4. A  `mktemp` command (to stage a downloaded zip-file)

# We rely upon naming conventions for release assets from GitHub to avoid
# having to parse JSON from their API, to avoid a dependency upon jq(1).
#
# <https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/linking-to-releases>
# guarantees that:
#    /<owner>/<name>/releases/latest/download/<asset-name>.zip
# will be available; going via the API we got, for 'latest':
#    https://github.com/nats-io/nsc/releases/download/0.4.0/nsc-linux-amd64.zip
# ie:
#    /<owner>/<name>/releases/download/<release>/<asset-name>.zip
# Inspecting headers, the documented guarantee redirects to the API-returned
# URL, which redirects to the S3 bucket download URL.

# Like the Python before us, we only support amd64 for now, and that's all that
# nsc releases.  By calling this out up top, it should make it easier to find
# the places which matter should that change in the future.
